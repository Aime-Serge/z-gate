/**
 * The visitor's IP for rate limiting - the website's answer to finding N-1
 * (docs/platform-v2/01-CURRENT-STATE-ASSESSMENT.md).
 *
 * X-Forwarded-For is a list: the client can put anything at its left end,
 * and each reverse proxy appends the address it received the request from.
 * Next.js itself does NOT append - it only fills the header in when it's
 * absent (`??=` in next/dist/server/base-server.js) - so with `trustedProxies`
 * proxies in front of the app, the real client is the entry that many places
 * from the right. With no trusted proxy the header is entirely
 * client-controlled and is ignored: everyone shares one "unknown" bucket,
 * which is safe (can't be spoofed) but strict.
