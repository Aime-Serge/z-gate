  "A gate is the one point where two different worlds agree to meet. That's the idea the company is named for. On one side sits the discipline of business — tax law, compliance, financial planning, professional skill. On the other sits technology — software, systems, data, automation. Most companies make a client walk back and forth between the two. Z-GATE puts both sides of that gate under one roof, as four divisions that already speak to each other.",
