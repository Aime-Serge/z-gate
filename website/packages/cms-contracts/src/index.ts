/**
 * Everything the website frontend may import from the CMS side
 * (`@zgate/cms-contracts`); the frontend never imports website/backend
 * itself, and .dependency-cruiser.cjs enforces that. Nothing here may
 * depend on Payload at runtime: content types are types only, generated
 * from the collections (payload-types.ts).
 *
 * Internal to the website: no other product uses it. The lead/waitlist
 * contract other Z-GATE products may rely on lives in
 * `@zgate/website-contracts`, re-exported here.
 *
 * Client components import `@zgate/website-contracts/constants`
 * instead, which has no dependencies (this module pulls in zod and
 * node:crypto).
